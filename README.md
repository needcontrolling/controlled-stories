# controlled-stories
Starting with a backup of my inlining-story-greatness onto the first site.
Then adapting it to work client/server w/ nodejs on the server and handling cross-site stuff, but still much happening on the client.
Then [hopefully soon] adding abstraction which allows crawling stories from other [preconfigured] sites.
We'll see after that.
